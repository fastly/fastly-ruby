# Fastly [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fastly/fastly-ruby.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fastly/fastly-ruby)

Client library for interacting with the Fastly web acceleration service [API](http://docs.fastly.com/api)

## Example

```ruby
# Gemfile
gem 'fastly'

# some_file.rb
fastly = Fastly.new(login_opts)

current_user     = fastly.current_user
current_customer = fastly.current_customer

user     = fastly.get_user(current_user.id)
customer = fastly.get_customer(current_customer.id)

puts "Name: #{user.name}"
puts "Works for #{user.customer.name}"
puts "Which is the same as #{customer.name}"
puts "Which has the owner #{customer.owner.name}"

# Let's see which services we have defined
fastly.list_services.each do |service|
  puts "Service ID: #{service.id}"
  puts "Service Name: #{service.name}"
  puts "Service Versions:"
  service.versions.each do |version|
    puts "\t#{version.number}"
  end
end

service        = fastly.create_service(:name => "MyFirstService")
latest_version = service.version

# Create a domain and a backend for the service ...
domain         = fastly.create_domain(:service_id => service.id, :version => latest_version.number, :name => "www.example.com")
backend        = fastly.create_backend(:service_id => service.id, :version => latest_version.number, :name => "Backend 1", :ipv4 => "192.0.43.10", :port => 80)

# ... and activate it. You're now hosted on Fastly.
latest_version.activate!

# Let's take a peek at the VCL that Fastly generated for us
vcl = latest_version.generated_vcl
puts "Generated VCL file is:\n#{vcl.content}"

# Now let's create a new version ...
new_version    = latest_version.clone
# ... add a new backend ...
new_backend    = fastly.create_backend(:service_id => service.id, :version => new_version.number, :name => "Backend 2", :ipv4 => "74.125.224.136", :port => 8080)
# ... add a director to switch between them
director       = fastly.create_director(:service_id => service.id, :version => new_version.number, :name => "My Director")
director.add_backend(backend)
director.add_backend(new_backend)
# ... and upload some custom vcl (presuming we have permissions)
new_version.upload_vcl(vcl_name, File.read(vcl_file))
# ... and set it as the service's main vcl
new_version.vcl(vcl_name).set_main!

new_version.activate!
```

## Contributing

1. Fork it
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Added some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create new Pull Request

### Notes for testing

Existing tests use a mocked api session recorded using VCR. If you need to add a new
test or the api changes, you'll need to record a new episode onto the vcr_cassette.
See test/helper.rb

In VCR recording mode, the test suite requires the following `ENV` variables to be set:

* `FASTLY_TEST_USER` - Your user email
* `FASTLY_TEST_PASSWORD` - Your account password
* `FASTLY_TEST_API_KEY` - Your API key (found at https://app.fastly.com/#account)

While the test suite is safe to be run on all accounts and isn't harmful to your
data, the tests will create and delete 3 services in sequence so you may want
to create an account just for tests.
