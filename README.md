Fastly - client library for interacting with the Fastly web acceleration service

# Example
 
    fastly = Fastly.new(login_opts)

    current_user     = fastly.current_user
    current_customer = fastly.current_customer

    user     = fastly.get_user(current_user.id)
    customer = fastly.get_customer(current_customer.id)

    puts "Name: #{user.name}"
    puts "Works for #{user.customer.name}"
    puts "Which is the same as #{customer.name}"
    puts "Which has the owner #{customer.owner.name}"

    # Let's see which services we have defined
    fastly.list_services.each do |service|
      puts "Service ID: #{service.id}"
      puts "Service Name: #{service.name}"
      puts "Service Versions:"
      service.versions.each do |version|
          puts "\t#{version.number}"
      end
    end

    service        = fastly.create_service(:name => "MyFirstService")
    latest_version = service.version

    # Create a domain and a backend for the service ...
    domain         = fastly.create_domain(:service_id => service.id, :version => latest_version.number, :name => "www.example.com")
    backend        = fastly.create_backend(:service_id => service.id, :version => latest_version.number, :ipv4 => "127.0.0.1", :port => 80)

    # ... and activate it. You're now hosted on Fastly.
    latest_version.activate

    # Let's take a peek at the VCL that Fastly generated for us
    vcl = latest_version.generated_vcl
    puts "Generated VCL file is:\n#{vcl.content}"

    # Now let's create a new version ...
    new_version    = latest_version.clone
    # ... add a new backend ...
    new_backend    = fastly.create_backend(:service_id => service.id, :version => new_version.number, :ipv4 => "192.168.0.1", :port => 8080)
    # ... and upload some custome vcl (presuming we have permissions)
    new_version.upload_vcl(vcl_name, File.read(vcl_file))

    new_version.activate
