    # :attr: address
    #
    # A magic field - will automagically be set to whichever of ipv4, ipv6 or hostname is currently set.

    #

    ##
    # :attr: ipv6
    #
    # the ipv6 address of the host to serve assets (this, hostname or ipv4 must be set)
    #

    ##
    # :attr: hostname
    #
    # the hostname to serve assets from (this, ipv4 or ipv6 must be set)

    #
    # whether to use ssl to get to the backend (default 0 i.e false)
    #

    ##
    # :attr: connect_timeout

    #

    ##
    # :attr: error_threshold
    #
    # how many errors before declaring the backend out of rotation (default 0, 0 meaning turned off)

    ##
    # :attr: ssl_cert_hostname

    # overrides ssl_hostname, but only for cert verification. Does not affect SNI at all.

    ##
    # :attr: ssl_sni_hostname
